== a) Decision support in computational pharmacology ==
Bioclipse Decision Support provides a framework for running exact match queries against a library of chemical structures, which was demonstrated for 3 open safety endpoints in the Bioclipse Decision Support paper.

=== Running Bioclipse Decision Support ===
Download the latest Bioclipse from Sourceforge.
Go to menu Install > DS Models and choose e.g. Ames Mutagenicity, AhR, or Carcinogenicity.
Open your query molecule in Bioclipse (e.g. start from SMILES or import a mol/cml/sdf file).
Switch to the Decision Support perspective (menu: Window > Open Perspective > Others...).
In the rightmost Decision Support view, press the Run button.

== b) Linked data spidering in Bioclipse with Isbjørn ==
Isbjørn is a plugin to Bioclipse that searches the Internet
for information about a molecule, initiated with the InChI and a web service we developed earlier, providing Universal Resource Identifiers for molecules, available at http://rdf.openmolecules.net/. This service provides a number of initial links to other Linked Data resources, and links to other resources are followed using owl:sameAs and skos:exactMatch predicates. The search results of Isbjørn are presented in Bioclipse as a HTML page and opened in a browser window.

== c) CDK tautomer calculation in Bioclipse moltable ==
The InChI library can be used to generate tautomers, a feature which is exposed in the Bioclipse Scripting Language (BSL). Below is an example script for calculating tautomers for phenol.

// no aromatic rings that make it hard to
// see where the double bonds are
jcpglobal.setShowAromaticity(false);
inputSMILES = "c1ccccc1O";
inputName = "phenol";
inchi.generate(
  cdk.fromSMILES(inputSMILES)
)
tautomers = cdk.getTautomers(
  cdk.fromSMILES(inputSMILES)
)
file = "/Virtual/" + inputName + ".sdf";
cdk.saveSDFile(file, tautomers);
ui.open(file);
